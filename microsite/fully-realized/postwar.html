    <h2>Post War</h2>
    <p>After US occupation in 1945, Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous plan, which preserved its pre-war street grid. In 1957, Munich's population surpassed one million. The city continued to play a highly significant role in the German economy, politics and culture, giving rise to its nickname Heimliche Hauptstadt ("secret capital") in the decades after World War II.</p>

    <p> In Munich, Bayerischer Rundfunk began its first television broadcast in 1954.[45]</p>
        
    <p> Since 1963, Munich has been the host city for annual conferences on international security policy.</p>
        
    <p> Munich also became known on the political level due to the strong influence of Bavarian politician Franz Josef Strauss from the 1960s to the 1980s. The Munich Airport (built in 1992) was named in his honor.[46]</p>
        
    <p> Munich was the site of the 1972 Summer Olympics, during which 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by Palestinian terrorists in the Munich massacre, when gunmen from the Palestinian "Black September" group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team. Mass murders also occurred in Munich in 1980 and 2016.</p>
        
    <p> Munich also hosted the FIFA World Cup finals in 1974.</p>
        
    <p> Munich is also home of the famous Nockherberg Strong Beer Festival during the Lenten fasting period (usually in March). Its origins go back to the 17th/18th century, but has become popular when the festivities were first televised in the 1980s. The fest includes comical speeches and a mini-musical in which numerous German politicians are parodied by look-alike actors.[47]</p>
        
    <p> Munich was one of the host cities for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.</p>
        
    <p> Munich was one of the host cities for the UEFA European 2020 soccer/football championship, (which was delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany).</p>
