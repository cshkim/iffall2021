        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <sub>Marinating Chicken</sub>
        <p>1. Combine the ingredients for the “chicken and marinade” in a bowl and mix together with a spoon. Cover and set aside. </p>
        <sub>Making Seasoning Sauce</sub>
        <p>1. Combine the ingredients for the “seasoning sauce” in a bowl. Mix well with a spoon and set aside.</p>
        <sub>Cooking Dakgalbi</sub>
        <p>1. Spread the cabbage on the bottom of a large, heavy, and shallow pan or skillet.  </p>
        <p> 2. Add onion, carrot, green chili pepper, sweet potato, rice cake, and perilla leaves in that order.  </p>
        <p> 3. Add chicken in the center. Pour the seasoning sauce over the chicken and spread with a wooden spoon. Add ½ cup water.  </p>
        <p> 4. Cover and cook for 3-4 minutes over medium high heat until it starts boiling. Turn down the heat to medium.

        <h2>Recipe Links</h2>
        <p><a href=https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/dakgalbi> MAANGCHI</a>    :The instructions are very clear and easy to follow, however the visual design of the website is disorienting. I do appreciate the attached video recipe at the beginning of the page though. </p>
        <p></p><a href=https://mykoreankitchen.com/dak-galbi> MyKoreanKitchen</a> : The recipe instructions are straightforward and clear and the left alignment gives the page a clean look. I also enjoy that each step is precise and comes with a complimentary photo that shows the action.</p>
        <p><a href=https://www.beyondkimchee.com/dak-galbi> BeyondKimchee</a> : Matching the website heading with the main color of the dish was very thoughtful and helps tie the visuals and instructions together. The highlights of certain significant words in orange also draws my attention to important ingredients/supplies that I may not have access to daily. The Nutritional information at the end is also super helpful.</p>

        <h2>Website Links</h2>
        <p><a href=https://beherenowchild.com/about> Be Here Now Child</a> :I really appreciate the fourth slide. The image/type on the left remains stagnant while the right can be swiped up and down. I think this would be a clever way of going through a recipe while keeping the end dish in mind to visualize how each ingredient and step comes together to create one dish.</p>
        <p> <a href=https://www.quarterskbbq.com>QUARTERS</a> :The main focus on this website is the food. The first thing you see is a fullscreen photo of meat on a grill. This communicates to viewers what is most important in the Quarters experience. </p>
        <p> <a href=https://www.boyish.com> boyish</a> :The chic style of this website gives it a clean and sophisticated look. When looking at a recipe, I believe that both written and visual clarity are key to making it easily comprehensible.</p>
