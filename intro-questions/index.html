        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Caitlin. I am a junior in comdes with a concentration in illustration.</p>
        <p>2. This is a required class for my major, but I am also very excited to learn coding basics to help me elevate my potential as a designer and artist.</p>
        <p>3. Nope</p>
        <p>4. I am hoping to learn the process of building websites even if I may never fully create one myself so I can at least have a better understanding when collaborating with webdeisgners and such.</p>
        <p>5. As said in class, I expect it to be much more organized. Designing for a screen is a completely new medium and I will have to take into consideration what type of "canvas" I am working with and how to make a design that is not only visually aesthetic but also intuitive.</p>
        <p>6. <a href="https://www.apple.com/"> APPLE</a>    : I never considered taking note of any websites I like but the first website to come to mind is apple.com because everytime I go on it I am always tempted to get a new device or accessory because you have to slide through multiple visually aesthetic slides to read the specs/info about their products. </p>
        <p>7. <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com"> HYDROFLASK</a>    : I picked hydroflask.com because I remember when I went on it to buy my water bottle, I had a multitude of choices and was given thorough information about the differences and quirks of each bottle/accessory.</p>
        <p>8. <a href="https://www.muji.com/us/"> MUJI</a>  : I love the design and intuitiveness of MUJI's website. The simplistic design compliments the showcase of MUJI's multiple categories as it automatically organizes the space.</p>
        <p>             </p>
        <p>thanks for reading!</p>
